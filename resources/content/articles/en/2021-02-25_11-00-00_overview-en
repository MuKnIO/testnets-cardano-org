## Overview
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a sandboxed virtual software stack, designed to enable the execution of smart contracts across a decentralized network of computers. It is embedded within every full Ethereum node, where every node on the network runs an instance, and thus reaches consensus.

The EVM provides a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. Contracts will typically be written in a higher-level programming language, like Solidity, or in a DSL like [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/), and then compiled to low level EVM bytecode.

By providing EVM support throughout our devnets programme, developers can write DApps in Solidity – Ethereum’s most popular smart contract language or Glow, as well as  other EVM languages, and in time deploy these contracts on Cardano via sidechains.
