## Devnet skill set

As in the case of the KEVM to use the EVM devnet the following skills are required:

- Familiarity with writing smart contracts in Solidity. You will need a suite of well-defined smart contracts to use on the devnet.
- Knowledge of the JSON remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.

No registration is required to use the devnet.
