## Supported platforms

During the first phase of the Cardano testnet, the node can run on at least the following supported platforms:

- Linux Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) or later
- Linux Mint 19.3 (Tricia) or later

Once the second phase of the testnet has begun, the following additional platforms will also be supported:

- Linux Debian 10.3 (Buster) or later
- MacOSX 10.14.0 (Mojave) or later
- Windows 10

It is also possible to run a testnet node on any platform using a virtual machine or applicable Docker CPU architecture image.
